## Description

This was a school project. The brief was to build an e-commerce website with a theme of our own choosing. I choose to make a shoe shop site and include three main catergories: Womens shoes, Mens shoes and Kids shoes. The products were to be added in the cart using local storage.

Building a checkout and payment system was not needed in this project.

API made with Strapi headless CMS, pictures hosted on Cloudinary, deployed with Heroku.

Elements this project had to include:

- Build a frontend with home, product list, product detail and cart pages.

- Build admin pages to create, update and delete products.

- The website must be responsive on all devices.
